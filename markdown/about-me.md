# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I'm Thomas Egger and the Chief Executive Officer of [RYEN](https://ryen.org/). 

I'm trying to find a balance between research and engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in exploring the capability of machines to be continual and efficient, like meta-learning, few-shot learning and continual learning. I'm also working on multi-modal retrieval for my internship.

I'm also learning to build machine learning softwares and systems. I'm also learning TypeScript, React and Vue.
